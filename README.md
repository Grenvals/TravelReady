## ðŸ“± Review

   The app is designed for quickly packing things into a suitcase or backpack for a trip, hike, or vacation. I am passionate about mountain hiking, and anyone who has gone on a hike knows how difficult it is to pack a backpack and make sure nothing is forgotten. Previously, I used Trello for this purpose, which is perfect for organizing work. However, when it comes to quickly packing, its interface is not convenient for this purpose. It has a lot of unnecessary functionality, and it often freezes on mobile devices.

## ðŸŒŽ How to install
   The app is cross-platform, so you can install it on your smartphone, computer, or use it in your browser. Personally, I often use it on my smartphone. The app does not require an internet connection, as all changes are saved locally.
